    <p>The Tyne & Wear Heritage Forum was formed in 2015 by representatives of local
    heritage groups active within the North-East of England. These groups celebrate
    the period of industrialization associated with Tyne & Wear, County Durham and
    Northumberland, when the region was at the forefront of world development during
    the period of the industrial revolution.</p>
    <p>The TWHF is an alliance of key heritage bodies and individuals active within the
    North-East of England. At a time of restricted public funding for protection and
    preservation of heritage, the Forum seeks to make a tangible and significant
    impact on the regional environment to the benefit of those who live and work
    here.</p>
